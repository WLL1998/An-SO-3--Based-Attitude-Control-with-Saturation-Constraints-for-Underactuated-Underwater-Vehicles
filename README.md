# An-SO-3--Based-Attitude-Control-with-Saturation-Constraints-for-Underactuated-Underwater-Vehicles
This paper presents a novel adaptive attitude control method for underactuated underwater vehicles  based on an $SO(3)$ that explicitly considers actuator non-linearity and hydrodynamic uncertainties.
