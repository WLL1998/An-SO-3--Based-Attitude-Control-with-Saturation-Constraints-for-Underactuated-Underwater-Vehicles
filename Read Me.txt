This code presents a novel adaptive attitude control method for underactuated underwater vehicles (UUVs) based on an $SO(3)$ that explicitly considers actuator nonlinearities and hydrodynamic uncertainties. The proposed controller achieves robust attitude tracking, including large pitch angles up to $\pm 90^{\circ}$. The outer-loop kinematics controller employs $SO(3)$ exponential mapping and an auxiliary variable to decouple the Euler attitude angles, while the inner-loop dynamics controller uses a novel finite-time integral sliding surface and incorporates saturation constraints, dead zones, and dynamic actuator effects. An interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2-FLS) adaptively estimates and compensates for model uncertainties. This controller design, based on a saturation function, effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by control input amplitude limitations.
